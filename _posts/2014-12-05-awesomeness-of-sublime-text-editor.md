[Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/) is one of the coolest text editor for code I have come across. If you are new to Sublime and are really interested in learning about the power of Sublime I would highly recommend you to attend free video course on [Tuts+ conducted by Jeffrey Way] (https://code.tutsplus.com/courses/perfect-workflow-in-sublime-text-2).

If you are in a hurry and would like to quickly know some benefits of Sublime Text continue reading.

## Shortcut keys

In the shortcut keys I'll be mentioning `super` which is `cmd` key if you are using **Mac** and `ctrl` key if you are using **Window**.

* `super + p` - Open any file using fuzzy search
* `super + shift + p` - Access to complete Sublime menu using fuzzy search
* `super + r` - Search methods in current file
* `super + i` - Instant incremental search in current file
* `super + /` - Toggle commenting out line
* `option   ` - For column select using mouse
* `super + w` - Closes current tab
* `super + =` - Zoom in
* `super + _` - Zoom out
* `super + d` - Selects next matching word
* `super + ctrl + g` - Select all matching words
* `super + shift + l` - Writes on all selected lines at the same time

## Package Control

Heart of Sublime Text are its plugins and the easiest way to install plugins is through Package Control.

Install Package control easily using steps mentioned over here <a href="https://sublime.wbond.net/installation">https://sublime.wbond.net/installation</a>

Once Package control is installed just press `super+shift+p` to open command prompt and type *install* and press enter to open search for package control. 

Search for any package you want to install and just press enter. Some plugins may require you to restart Sublime.

## Snippets

Snippets are smart templates that will insert text for you and adapt it to their context. For e.g. in an html file if you type in `<a` and then press tab it will complete the tag template for you `<a href=""></a>`.

To see what snippets are already installed with Sublime, press `super+shit+p` and type **Snippets**, select the one you want to use and press enter.

You can also install snippets created by community. For e.g. I use groovy language and by default Sublime doesn't come with groovy snippets. To install them open command prompt using `super+shit+p` and type **install**, press enter to open Package control and type **groovy snippets**, select the groovy snippets plugin and press enter.

To test groovy snippets create a new groovy file and type `for` and press `tab` **for** syntax will be completed by groovy snippets.

You can even create you own [snippets](http://sublime-text-unofficial-documentation.readthedocs.org/en/latest/extensibility/snippets.html#snippets-file-format).

## Plugins

As mentioned above plugins is what makes Sublime Text so special, and now that we have already installed package control, lets review some nice plugins.
